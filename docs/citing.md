# Citing <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span></span> 

We are very happy that *Simple**FOC**library* has been used as a component of several research project and has made its way to several scientific papers.  We are hoping that this trend is going to continue as the project matures and becomes more robust! 
A short resume paper about *Simple**FOC*** has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software: 
<p>
  <b><i>SimpleFOC</i></b>: A Field Oriented Control (FOC) Library for Controlling Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) and Stepper Motors.<br>
