# Practical guides

This is the section intended for the practical guides and explanations of different procedures when it comes to interacting with BLDC motors and the  <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span>. We will try to populate this section with as much material as possible to help you with your projects. This is also a section with a lot of potential for community contributions. If you have a guide that you think would be useful to the community, please feel free to contribute! 

Additionally, there are many different useful practical information already available on our community servers - <a href="https://community.simplefoc.com">read more</a>. We encourage you to check it out and feel free to ask any questions you might have.
